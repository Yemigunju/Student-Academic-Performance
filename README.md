# üéì Student Academic Performance Analysis

## üìö Project Overview

This project investigates the factors influencing student academic performance, focusing on study habits and attendance patterns. Through data analysis and visualization, it identifies key trends that differentiate high-performing students from others, offering insights for better educational strategies and support systems.

---

## üéØ Project Objective

- Analyze the impact of study hours per week and attendance percentage on academic performance.
- Classify students based on performance tiers (e.g., Excellent, Good, Average, Poor).
- Provide actionable insights for educators and students to enhance academic outcomes.

---

## üß† Methodology

- **Data Collection:** Student academic datasets including study hours, attendance, and final scores.
- **Data Cleaning:** Treated missing values, corrected anomalies, and normalized performance scores.
- **Feature Engineering:** Derived performance classifications based on predefined scoring thresholds.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualized correlations between study hours, attendance, and performance.

**Tools Used:**  
`Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)`, `Power BI`, `Excel`

## üìä Key Insights

- **Study Hours Correlation:** Students who studied more than 15 hours per week generally performed better academically.
- **Attendance Matters:** Attendance rates above 90% correlated strongly with high performance classifications.
- **Performance Clusters:** Students were classified into clear tiers based on the combination of study time and attendance.
- **Combined Effect:** High study hours alone did not guarantee success without consistent attendance, and vice versa.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

The analysis highlights the combined importance of dedicated study time and consistent attendance in driving student success. Institutions can leverage these findings to design interventions, encourage better study habits, and monitor attendance closely as part of academic improvement programs.
